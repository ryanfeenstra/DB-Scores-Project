# DB-Scores-Project
The aim of the project was to utilise machine learning with the aim of predicting the DB (Doing Business) scores for a select group of countries. Various datasets including indicators for countries were combined and inserted into various machine learning models to accurately predict DB scores for a few selected countries. The models that were tried included: Linear Model, Penalized Regression (LASSO), and Elastic Net Regression. The LASSO and Elastic Net regressions were both tested for RMSE using lambda 1se and lambda min, leading to to the LASSO model with lambda 1se being deemed the most accurate. The LASSO with lambda 1se was then used to predict the DB scores for the countries of Armenia, China, Mozambique, Slovenia and Thailand.
